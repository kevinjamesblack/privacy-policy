# Privacy Policy #

Last Updated: February 24, 2026

This Privacy Policy applies to the **Quotables** macOS application (the "Application").

**1. Overview:**
The Application is designed to be a privacy-first utility. Its primary function is to display quotes from a user-selected text file or internal resource within a macOS Menu Bar and Widget.

**2. Information Collection and Use:**
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
* _Personal Data: No names, email addresses, or identifiers are requested or stored._
* _Quote Files: When you select a text file from your Desktop or local storage, the Application only reads the contents of that file to display quotes. These files stay on your device and are never uploaded to any servers._
* _Usage Data: We do not track how often you use the app or which quotes are displayed._

**3. Third-Party Access:**
Because we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or trade any information with third parties. There are no third-party analytics or advertising SDKs integrated into the Application.

**4. Data Storage:**
All application preferences (such as your choice of quote file) are stored locally on your Mac using standard macOS defaults or sandboxed containers.

**5. Changes to This Policy:**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.

**6. Contact Us:**
